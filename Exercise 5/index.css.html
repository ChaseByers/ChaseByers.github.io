   <strong> Fire and Ice </strong>
   <br> Robert Frost </h1>

<p>&ldquo;Some say the world will end in <span class="fire">fire</span>,<br />
Some say in <span>ice</span>.<br />
From what I’ve tasted of desire<br />
I hold with those who favor<span>fire</span>.<br />
But if it had to perish twice,<br />
I think I know enough of hate<br />
To say that for destruction <span>ice</span><br />
Is also great<br />
And would suffice.&rdquo;<br>
        –Robert Frost</em></p>
